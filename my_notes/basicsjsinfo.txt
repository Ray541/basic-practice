words and keyword - 
    --words - anything that have no meaning in js is a simple words
        eg - eleven, ray, something
    --keyword - anything that have meaning in js is a keyword
        eg - for, var, while, is


variable and constants - 
    --variable - used to store values in js but can be changed over the time
    --constant - used to store some value but is constant in the whole program

[Advanced] difference in var let and const
    -old js i.e ES5 var     vs      -new js i.e ES6 let and const
    -functional scope               -braces scope
    -adds window object             -doens't add window object


hoisting - 
    variable and functions are hoisted means the variable declaration is moved to the top of the code


types in js -
    1] primitive :- number, string, boolean, undefined, null

    2] reference :- [] - array, () -, {} - object

1] primitive type eg -
    number - var a = 10;
    string - var s = "Ray"
    boolean - var b = true/false
    undefined - var x
    null - var y = null

2] reference type eg - 
    array - var fruits = ["grapes", "mango", "pineapple"]
    object - var person = 
    {
        name: "Ray",
        age: "22"
    }

conditionals:- if else else-if

if that then 
    something
else 
    something else

if
{
    something
}
else if(condition)
{
    other thing
}
else
{
    some other thing
}


Loops :- for, while, 
[must know but latter] foreach, forin, forof, do-while
repeat same line of code we use loop


Functions:- 
    used for mainly three tasks:- 
        1)when we want to run some code latter
        2)when we want to reuse some code
        3)when we want to run with some different data every other time

function areaOfSquare
{
    get the side of square
    return formula
}

paramenters:- it is a variable in which we can pass the values to function in the form of value
eg- areaofRectangle(length, width)

argument:- the real value passed in the parameter
eg- areaofRectangle(2, 3)


array - We can store multipe values. its group of values under one variable name

var number = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]


index        0  1  2  3  4
var number= [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]


push, pop, unshift, shift

push(6) - add element at last
pop(5) - remove element from last
unshift(6) - add element in start
shift(5) - add element in end
splice(2, 2) - remove elements form anywhere


Object:- store information in key value pair

syntax:- 

    var object_name =
    {
        property/prop : "value"
    }

empty object :
    var a = {}

object with values :
    var person = 
    { 
        name: "Ray",
        age: "22",
        github: "Ray541"
    }

    var bike =
    {
        name: "H2",
        color: "Metal Black",
        price: "72,000,00"
    }

we can also have functions and arrays as a properties also. a function in the object is called as method

update property:-

    bike.name = "H2R"
