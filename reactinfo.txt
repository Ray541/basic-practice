 - react?
-->     React is a JavaScript library.
        developed by facebook in 2011.
        we can create spa using react and it is lightweight.
        it uses the virtual dom to change the elements in the on any event.

 - SPA and MPA?
-->     SPA =>
            SPA works inside the browser and does not needs reload during it's use.
            No page reload no wait time required.
            Single html file and multiple js files.

        MPA =>
            MPA is traditional methos of developing.
            more reload time and more wait time.
            this is beacuse there are multiple html file so if a user request server to render the content the the server returns a file and then it renders the whole html file.

 - Create React Project?
-->     npm create-react-app filename
            This takes much time to start the development server.

        npm start
        
        Other method to create a react Project is with Vite

        npm create vit@latest
        Project Name:
        slecect framework

        npm run dev

        This vite appliction is faster than the simple react app and needs less time to start and loading any changes.

 - Webpack?
-->     Latest version is webpack 5
        Webpack is a bundler. It is a JavaScript module bundeler.
        It takes all the individual files and other assets like images and the css files and combiles them into one single bundle which can run in the browser.

        Use:-
            Build
            Js and CSS Minify
            Entry File

        webpack file structure:-
            in root folder create a webpack.config.js file 

        now, if we use typescript the browser will not understand the files so we need the bab el to convert the ts file to js file and then the browser will understand the code and babel config file babelrc.json to configure babel.

        npm install --save-dev @babel/core @babel/cli.

        JavaScript file extension is filename.jsx
        TypeScript file extension is filename.tsx

        the webpack is a bundler and the bundle.js file should always be in the build folder

        HTMLWebpackPlugin file:
            what this does in it injects the bundle.js file in index,html file which is the only html file in the whole react app.



build > holds all the file required for build i.e. bundle file
src > source code

packages required:-
react: to write in react language
react-dom: for routing purpose

 - useState?
-->     
    variable with the state setState Function. it's a hook which is used to update the values in the state in react.
        eg:-
            import {useState} from "react"

            const [state, setState] = useState();

 - Formik and Yup Libraries for React?
-->
    Formik is the stand alone library built for better and easier form handelling in react and it supports yup which is use for easier form validation.
